  - add generic Toradex config block handling, print exact product description,
    board revision and serial number to the console

    within Linux userspace through procfs (/proc/device-tree/serial-number,
    toradex,board-rev and toradex,product-id)
  - add command to restore Toradex config block ("cfgblock create")

  - add display (DCU) support along with some default modes, display the Toradex
    logo at VGA resolution by default

  - use configfs for USB Gadget configuration
  - improve NAND read performance by supporting OOB only read
  - improve NAND write performance by removing unnecessary page reads on write
  - export Vybrid SoC information such as ROM revision and unique ID through
    SoC bus (/sys/devices/soc0/machine, family, soc_id and revision)
- Linux user-space:
  - update OpenEmbedded from daisy to dizzy:
    - glibc 2.20 (instead of eglibc)
    - systemd 2.18
    - Xorg 1.14.7
    - updated various LXDE packages to newer versions

    on module side, typically ttyACM0 on host side)
  - replace full NTP daemon with systemd's NTP client only systemd-timesyncd

  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Note:
- mount point names changed from /media/<block device name> to /media<label>
- The kernel requires now the device tree from within the root filesystem to
  boot. Board customisation within code are for most use cases not necessary.
  For custom carrier boards, it is recommended to create a customised
  device tree file and deploy it in the root filesystems /boot directory.
  U-Boot reads the device tree according to the following name scheme:
  => ${soc}-colibri-${fdt_board}.dtb

  Hence, a custom carrier board needs to set the fdt_board variable accordingly
  and would name the device tree files using the SoC prefix depending on the
  supported module type:
  => vf500-colibri-mycarrier.dtb
  => vf610-colibri-mycarrier.dtb

Known Issues:
- If the module does not boot, remove all displays connected to HSYNC, VSYNC and reset.
  (This has been observed on an Evaluation Board V2.1C)
- Downgrade is not possible through "run update" due to NAND ECC layout changes
  refer to the flashing instruction article to flash the module from scratch
- Audio capture does not work due to a bug in the device tree

  (This has been observed on an Evaluation Board V2.1C)
- Downgrade does not work with "run setupdate". For downgrade, use
  mmc rescan && && fatload mmc 0:1 ${loadaddr} flash_mmc.img && source ${loadaddr}
  instead, then the usual "run update"
- Boot from SD-card does not work out of the box, sddtbparm net to be updated:
  setenv sddtbload 'setenv dtbparam; load mmc 0:2 ${fdt_addr_r} \
		${soc}-colibri-${fdt_board}.dtb && \
		"/boot/${soc}-colibri-${fdt_board}.dtb && \

Note:
- We use now zImage instead of uImage kernel image format and moved the kernel
  inside the root filesystem. If you use custom U-Boot scripts, you need to
  alter those scripts accordingly.

Known Issues:
- If the module does not boot remove all displays connected to HSYNC, VSYNC and reset.
  (This has been observed on an Evaluation Board V2.1)
- Analogue audio is not working on the Colibri VF61
