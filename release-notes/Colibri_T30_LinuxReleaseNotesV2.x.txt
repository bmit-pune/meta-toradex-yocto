  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Note:
- mount point names changed from /media/<block device name> to /media<label>
- no SD boot integration yet but copying cbootimage to beginning of SD card
  will at least boot

Known Issues:
- default vidargs includes 'fbcon=map:1' which causes the framebuffer console
    only ever to be visible on a DVI-D aka HDMI screen should there any such
    actually be connected. Just removing this either from within the U-Boot
    console as follows:
      setenv vidargs video=tegrafb0:640x480-16@60; saveenv
    or from within Linux:
      fw_setenv vidargs video=tegrafb0:640x480-16@60
    fixes this by defaulting back to showing it on DVI-A aka VGA resp. parallel
    RGB.
- connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec, so that
    neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic
    connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
- on first boot the resizing process adversely affects system performance for
    the first few minutes until completed
- flash_eth.img requires manual splitting of the root.ext3 file.
    see the colibri-t30_bin/flash_eth.scr script
- LP1 suspend might fail due to pending USB interrupts
- LP1 suspend might hang due to display controller issue

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.1 Beta 2 (February 6, 2014)
- U-Boot:
  - Add more UART configurations to the device trees allowing easy switching of
    the console UART port by changing the UART base address of the console node
    within the device tree.
  - Fix EHCI periodic list handling.
  - Add default VESA VGA vidargs for our now modedb enabled kernel. This allows
    easy specifying an alternate parallel RGB resolution.
  - Fix usbboot option to be more in-line with how we do optional MMC/SD card
    boot on Colibri VF50/VF61. Loads the uimage kernel from the first partition
    being formatted as VFAT and instructs the kernel to mount the second
    partition formatted as ext3 as root file system.
- Linux kernel:
  - Use TPS6591X IRQ base define to calculate correct IRQ number.
  - Remove vdd_hdmi_con regulator from dc1 since we don't have a dedicated
    regulator for this connector on our baseboards.
  - Fix HDMI suspend/resume by avoiding division by zero oops.
  - Don't register KEY_BACK for wakeup.
  - Add STMPE ADC driver using IIO framework
    (see http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/adc-(linux)).
  - Use modedb to specify framebuffer resolution (see
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/framebuffer-(linux) and
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/x-server-(linux)).
  - Check null pointers for sysfs calls.
  - Hack to avoid 24 Hz mode in X resulting in no display at all. This has been
    encountered using e.g. a Samsung SyncMaster F2380 if connected by HDMI.
  - Add kernel parameters to change RGB clock polarity.
  - Re-work Fusion multi-touch touchscreen driver.
  - Before updating modes on HDMI hotplug, check if framebuffer is registered
    at all. This allows to disable framebuffers completely.
- rootfs / oe-core:
  - Fix build and texinfo errors for stress.
  - Add sections for both monitor outputs to xorg.conf. Add example
    configuration to disable an output as well as select preferred mode.
  - Add entry for fusion touchscreen driver to xorg.conf.
  - Add fstrim from util-linux.
  - Add kernel module for fusion touch screens (see
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/capacitive-multi-touch-display-(linux)).
  - burnflash: Account for fs overhead and many files.

      /proc/cpuinfo in Linux).
- Linux kernel:
  - Fix several HDMI hang issues.
  - Support default watchdog API (see
      http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/watchdog-(linux)).
  - Disable magic SysRq key configuration as this is not only a potential
       security thread but can cause serious trouble if for some reason UART pins
       are left floating and therefore cause unexpected break conditions.
  - Add DDR speed definition for 400 and 800 MHz.
  - HDMI: Retry EDID reads up to 4 times until failing.

- rootfs / oe-core:

- Iris V1.1a
  - connect serial debug console to UARTA aka FFUART X13 using null modem RS-232 cable and a
      10 pin IDC to 9 pin D-sub male connector. (DTK or Intel standard)
  - insert above prepared micro SD card into micro SD card socket (X10)
- Boot to U-Boot prompt and start the update:
  - apply power or reset
  - hit any key to stop auto booting
  - if you update from a previous image use the following U-Boot commands:
      setenv drive 1
      setenv setupdate 'mmc dev ${drive}; mmc rescan; fatload mmc ${drive}:1 ${loadaddr} flash_blk.img; source ${loadaddr}'
      saveenv
  - use 'run setupdate' U-Boot command and then
  - use 'run update' U-Boot command unless you are updating from an older image
    in which case:
    - use 'run update_uboot' command and power cycle or reset and hit any key
      to stop auto booting
    - use 'env default -a' command followed by 'saveenv' command
    - power cycle or reset again and hit any key to stop auto booting
    - use 'run setupdate' U-Boot command and then
    - use 'run migrate_v2.3b1' U-Boot command

Boot from eMMC:
- EvalBoard V3.1a
  - do no longer press SW9
- Iris V1.1a
  - do no longer short any pins of JP1
- power cycle
- upon first boot post-install scripts are run which takes around 2 minutes,
    please be patient

If the boot loader on the module got corrupted this recovers it by loading U-Boot
  over USB into the module's RAM and executing it there:
- EvalBoard V3.1a
  - connect USB B (X29) or USB micro A/B (X30) to development workstation using
      regular or micro USB cable
  - the jumper JP2 must be open
  - connect serial debug console as stated above
  - press and hold recovery mode switch (SW9) during power up
- Iris V1.1a
  - connect USB micro A/B (X12) to development workstation using regular micro USB
      cable
  - connect serial debug console as stated above
  - short pin 1-2 of JP1 on Iris for RECOVERY
(other carrier boards see http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/txx-recovery-mode)
- make sure that the carrier board supports USB high speed
  - Iris & EvalBoard V3.1a OK, for other carrier boards see
      http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/usb-2.0-high-speed-%28480mbps%29
- have the module in recovery mode and load U-Boot over USB to the module's RAM:
  - lsusb should show a '0955:7130 NVidia Corp.' device if the module is in recovery mode
  - run ./update.sh -d
  - stop at the U-Boot prompt and begin the update as stated above
